# About me

Hi ! I'm Guillaume, 25 years old, and I'm a French software engineer. I've graduated from INSA Lyon in September 2014, where I studied Computer Science, Telecommunications and Networks.
I'm currently working at Stormshield, a security solutions provider, where I'm taking part in the development of a centralized administration service for Stormshield appliances.

What defines me the most is challenge. I'm interested and passionate about multiple fields in Computer Science and I'm ready to take up these as long as it challenges me.

I have been involved at Intel Germany in the creation of a demonstration of the Intel Puma 6 platform, a services gateway for cable operators and broadcasters. It has been shown at IBC 2013, Amsterdam, and CES 2014, Las Vegas. I mostly took over the front-end part – JavaScript + Backbone.js –, where TV services and EPG data were displayed within the browser, but also handled the configuration, administration and maintenance of the Linux-based embedded platform and worked closely with Intel's partners to get their software ready and optimized.

I also did research at the IPADS lab, hosted by the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, on dynamic parallelization of JVM-based applications.

At previous employers, I've worked with C++/Qt applications ([Open-Sankoré](//github.com/Sankore/Sankore-3.1)) or PHP – I developed and integrated a monitoring tool handling critical KPIs.

Some of the projects I led or worked on:

 * [PIE](//github.com/PieEditor/PIE): a collaborative workshop for document writing - back-end architect / node.js + CouchDB, RESTful API;
 * [msgr](//code.google.com/p/msgr): a simple RSS aggregator - back-end architect / PHP + MySQL, API, DB scheme, stored procedures and triggers;
 * [jActor](//code.google.com/p/jactor): a lightweight (yet stupid) implementation of the Actor-oriented paradigm in Java - technical lead / Java, reflection, threads, distributed programming;
 * a P2P client over a ring-based architecture - technical lead / C, network programming.
